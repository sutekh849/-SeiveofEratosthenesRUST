# Seive of Eratosthenes

This is a Seive of Eratosthenes implementation used to find prime numbers..
I have successfully generated a 17gb file of prime numbers using this which ends
in the prime 33906393741. This, not unexpectedly, took a long time due to the creation of such a large vector<bool> object, despite bit compression. 

This is almost exactly as fast as the C++ version in my other repo and was created as an exercise in the Rust programming language.
